      <![CDATA[<p><strong>Unroasted Argan oil is traditionally used as a treatment for skin diseases and as cosmetic oil for skin and hair:</strong></p>
<p><strong>"In cosmetics, Unroasted Argan oil is advocated as moisturizing oil, against juvenile acne and flaking of the skin as well as for nourishing the hair. This oil has also medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns ... Externally, Argan oil is used ... for hair as brilliantine, to fortify and ... in the treatment of wrinkled or scaly dry skin".</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unroasted Argan oil has become increasingly popular for cosmetic use. The number of personal-care products on the US market with Argan oil as an ingredient increased from just two in 2007 to over one hundred by 2011. It is sometimes mixed with pomegranate seed oil due to its anti oxidizing benefits; with vendors promoting this blend as an all-in-one serum both for skin and hair. Argan oil is also sold without additives as a natural skincare and hair care product.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The increasing popularity of Unroasted Argan oil has prompted the Moroccan  government to plan for increased production: its aim is to increase annual production from approximately 2,500 to 4,000 tonnes by 2020.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Composition : </strong><strong>100% pure Argan oil .</strong></p>]]>

<li>Spreads and Ice Cream Toppings</li>
</ol>
<p>In Moroccan cooking Culinary Argan Oil ZINEGLOB is used for its toasted, creamy, nutty flavour.</p>
<p>It is rarely used for high-temperature cooking and frying.<br>Culinary Argan Oil can be used for medium heat applications such as pan-frying ingredients, frying onions or frying a chicken with spices.</p>
<p><span>ZINEGLOB </span><span>Culinary Argan Oil For Cooking </span><span>and</span><span> Health</span></p>

<p><span>ZINEGLOB </span><span>Culinary Argan Oil For Cooking </span><span>and</span><span> Health</span></p>
<p>Use to create sweet sauces, pour on grilled goat cheese with almonds, blend with honey to create a breakfast spread, blend with melted chocolate or cream to create unique ice cream toppings.</p>
<p>In Morocco this oil is most often enjoyed dipping bread into the oil and eating</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ZINEGLOB Culinary Argan Oil For Cooking and Health</p>
<p>Many studies now confirm that Culinary Argan Oil could be of value in treating symptoms of some difficult health problems.</p>
<p><span>ZINEGLOB </span><span>Culinary Argan Oil For Cooking </span><span>and</span><span> Health</span></p>
<p>The oil is made up of a complex of antioxidants, fatty acids, Beta Amyrine, Butyrospermol, Lupenol, plant sterols and other powerful of bio-active nutrients.<br>When eaten as a supplement or added to food when cooking these nutrients have been proven to have strong health benefits for the treatment of many common health problems such as:</p>
<ol title="Health Benefits of Culinary Argan Oil">
<li>Cholesterol Reduction</li>
<li>Cardiovascular Disease – Heart Disease</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Arthritis</li>
<li>Weight &amp; BMI</li>
</ol>
<p>You should always use toasted, culinary Argan Oil for a dietary supplement. Cosmetic Argan Oil is quite safe to eat but does not have the same properties. This is because the toasting process brings our certain health properties from the Argan Nut Kernels.</p>
<p><span>ZINEGLOB </span><span>Culinary Argan Oil For Cooking </span><span>and</span><span> Health</span></p>
<p>You should also be aware that in Morocco we produce two slightly different types of Culinary Argan Oil.<br>One is used for dipping and eating with bread. This type of culinary Argan Oil has a stronger, more toasted bitter flavour and may be darker in colour.</p>
<p>However, the stronger toasting process reduces the healthy properties of the oil a little and can leave it a little bitter for cooking with.</p>
<p><span>ZINEGLOB </span><span>Culinary Argan Oil For Cooking </span><span>and</span><span> Health</span></p>
<p>The other type is toasted less. It is more suitable for use in cooking as it has a milder, creamy and nutty flavour without bitterness.</p>
<p><span>ZINEGLOB </span><span>Culinary Argan Oil For Cooking </span><span>and</span><span> Health</span></p>
<p>To make this grade of oil the nut kernels must be expertly toasted at just the right temperature and for the right length of time to allow the taste, aroma and colour to develop without compromising the nutritional value or reducing the vitamin E content. </p>
<p>This is the best type of culinary Argan Oil to use as a health supplement and for cooking. It is currently the only grade that we stock.</p>
<p>You will find detailed explainations of the health benefits of using culinary Argan Oil in our separate, in-depth articles.</p>

      <![CDATA[<span>For centuries, Amazigh Moroccan women (Berbers or sleuths) of southwestern Morocco use Argan Oil for their food and cosmetic virtues. The people in this region have used and processed the oil for generations employing thousands of women. They have turned argan oil into one of the main economic opportunities in a region stricken by poverty and unemployment, where the only alternatives are livestock or migration. For years ZINEGLOB, extracts, produces and exports Argan Oil from Agadir where it is based in southwestern Morocco abroad to many countries. ZINEGLOB the famous Argan Oil company founded on 2006 in Agadir city on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean is a leader in its field, it is the renowned manufacturer of organic argan oil and the best organic products factory in Morocco. Beside the pure Argan Oil, ZINEGLOB is known for producing and exporting various other organic products: pure prickly pear oil, rose water, ghassoul clay, and creams …. etc. In this article, we will focus on the argan oil the little miracle for the Skin, Hair and Health, and the main ZINEGLOB’s products. Argan Oil production has always a socioeconomic function. For centuries the oil has been extracted from the inside nuts through an exhausting, slowly-mastered craft local women learn since an early age, and then pass on to the next generation.</span>]]>
